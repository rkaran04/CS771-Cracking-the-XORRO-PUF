# CS771-Cracking-the-XORRO-PUF
This is a course project for the course CS771: intro to machine learning (IIT Kanpur).

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Advanced XOR Ring Oscillator Physical Unclonable Functions (XORRO PUFs) using linear models. XORRO PUFs are used in cryptographic systems for secure key generation and authentication. The goal of this analysis is to develop and validate linear models capable of predicting the responses of both simple and advanced XORRO PUFs based on challenge vectors and frequency differences.

## Key Features
- **Derivation of Linear Model**: The derivation of how a complex XORRO PUF condenses into a linear model is provided in the report.
- **Linear Model Development**: Created linear models to predict PUF responses, illustrating the effectiveness of linear analysis in evaluating the security of XORRO PUFs.
- **Response Prediction**: Developed methods to analyze and predict PUF responses, contributing to understanding the robustness of PUF-based cryptographic systems.

## How It Works

1. **Challenge Vector Analysis**: The project examines the relationship between challenge vectors and PUF responses.
2. **Frequency Difference Calculation**: Calculates frequency differences to predict responses of XORRO PUFs.
3. **Model Validation**: Tests the linear models against real XORRO PUF data to evaluate their accuracy and effectiveness.
